# Game Recharge Platform

A multi-tenant game recharge platform prototype built with Next.js 16, Supabase, and Stripe. This MVP provides a complete purchase flow for Players and role-gated dashboards for Merchants and Admins.

## Current status

This repository is a prototype. The sections below describe its intended workflows and implementation; production readiness, tenant isolation, payment fulfillment and the listed test coverage still require independent verification. The repository homepage lists a deployment, whose current behavior has not been validated in this documentation update.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router and React Server Components (RSC)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with Google OAuth
- **Payment**: Stripe Checkout with Webhook integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with Radix UI components
- **Language**: TypeScript 5 with end-to-end type safety
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **Internationalization**: next-intl (English/Chinese)

### Key Features

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Strict data isolation between merchants
- **Role-based Access Control**: User, Merchant, and Admin roles
- **Complete Purchase Flow**: From product selection to payment confirmation
- **Real-time Updates**: Live order status and inventory management
- **Multi-language Support**: Full internationalization with dynamic routing
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Stripe integration with idempotency guarantees
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with accessibility in mind

## 🎮 User Roles & Access Control

### Players (USER)
- Browse games and purchase SKUs
- View order history
- Manage profile information

### Merchants (MERCHANT)
- Manage own games and SKUs
- View sales analytics and orders
- **Strict Data Tenancy**: Can only access their own data

### Administrators (ADMIN)
- Full platform oversight
- User management
- Cross-merchant analytics

## 💳 Payment Flow

1. **Product Selection**: User selects a game SKU
2. **Order Creation**: Server creates pending order with Stripe Checkout Session
3. **Payment Processing**: User completes payment via Stripe Checkout
4. **Webhook Verification**: Stripe sends payment confirmation to webhook endpoint
5. **Order Fulfillment**: System updates order status and processes fulfillment

### Security Features

- **Idempotency**: Webhook processing checks for duplicate orders
- **Signature Verification**: All webhook signatures are verified
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Data Validation**: All inputs validated using Zod schemas

## 🌍 Internationalization

The platform supports multiple languages with dynamic routing:

- **English**: `/en/...` (default)
- **Chinese**: `/zh/...`

### Adding New Languages

1. Add translation files in `messages/` directory
2. Update `src/i18n/config.ts` with new locale
3. Run `pnpm lint` to ensure consistency

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit & Integration Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Run Playwright tests
pnpm e2e

# Run specific test
pnpm e2e:payment
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Server Actions**: Tested with Vitest
- **Components**: Tested with React Testing Library
- **Payment Flow**: End-to-end testing with Stripe test mode
- **RLS Policies**: Database policy testing
- **Authentication**: Full auth flow testing

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All database tables implement RLS policies
- Merchants can only access their own data
- Role-based access control enforced at database level

### Server Actions Security
- All actions use `next-safe-action` with Zod validation
- Input sanitization and type checking
- Rate limiting and error handling

### Payment Security
- PCI compliance through Stripe integration
- Webhook signature verification
- No sensitive data stored in client-side code

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### Merchant Dashboard
- Sales overview with charts
- Order history and status tracking
- Revenue analytics by game and SKU
- Customer insights

### Admin Dashboard
- Platform-wide metrics
- Merchant management
- Financial reporting
- System health monitoring

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure all variables from `.env.local` are configured in production:
- Supabase URLs and keys
- Stripe keys and webhook secret
- Application URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`)

### Database Migration

```bash
# Push schema changes to production
pnpm exec supabase db push  # after explicitly linking the intended project
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint and format code
pnpm lint

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Run all quality checks
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test
```

### Git Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically:
- Biome formatting and linting
- Type checking
- Test execution on affected files

### Adding New Features

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement Server Actions in `src/actions/`
3. Create components in `src/components/features/`
4. Add tests in appropriate test directories
5. Update internationalization files
6. Run full test suite before PR

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript strict mode conventions
- Use RSCs by default, minimize `"use client"`
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add comprehensive tests for new features
- Update documentation for API changes

## 📚 API Documentation

### Server Actions

All business logic is implemented as Server Actions:

- `auth.actions.ts` - Authentication operations
- `games.actions.ts` - Game and SKU management
- `payment.actions.ts` - Payment processing
- `order.actions.ts` - Order management

### API Routes

- `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Stripe webhook handler
- Authentication uses Supabase Auth; see `src/actions/auth.actions.ts`.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Stripe Webhook Not Working**
- Ensure webhook secret is correctly configured
- Check that Stripe CLI is running in development
- Verify webhook endpoint is accessible

**Database Connection Issues**
- Check Supabase configuration in `.env.local`
- Ensure PgBouncer URL is used for server-side clients
- Verify RLS policies are correctly implemented

**Authentication Problems**
- Check Supabase Auth configuration
- Ensure redirect URLs are configured in Supabase dashboard
- Verify NextAuth secret is set

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
# Run with debug logging
DEBUG=* pnpm dev
```
